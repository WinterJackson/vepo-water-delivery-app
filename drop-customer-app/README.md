# Drop Customer App 💧

> The consumer-facing application for the Drop Multivendor Water Delivery Platform. Built with Expo, React Native, and Tailwind CSS (NativeWind).

## 📱 Overview

The Drop Customer App allows users to browse nearby water vendors, order water (both retail refills and wholesale), track deliveries in real-time, and manage empty bottle returns.

### Core Features
- **Location-based Discovery**: Find nearby vendors using device GPS and GeoSpatial queries (H3 hex indexing).
- **Checkout & Payments**: Seamless integration with Safaricom M-Pesa (STK Push) for instant payments.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: WebSocket integration for live rider location tracking on a map.
- **Gamification & Loyalty**: Welcome discounts, wallet cashback, and repeat-order incentives.
- **Empty Bottle Management**: Track bottle debt and return empty bottles to vendors during delivery (Quick Swap).
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full theming support aligned with the Drop BRAND design system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Routing**: [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) (File-based routing)
- **Styling**: [NativeWind v4](https://www.nativewind.dev/) (Tailwind CSS)
- **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) (Client state) & [TanStack Query v5](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (Server state)
- **Authentication**: [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) (Email, Phone OTP, OAuth)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- pnpm
- Expo CLI (`npm i -g expo-cli`)
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

2. Configure Environment Variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of this app and add:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://<YOUR_IP>:8000
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIza...
   ```
   > **Note**: For physical device testing, `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL` must be your computer's local IP address, not `localhost`.

## 🔄 Business Logic Details

### Order Placement Flow
1. User adds items to the Cart (checked against vendor distance limits: 2km for retail, 15km for wholesale).
2. User proceeds to checkout, selects delivery location.
3. System calculates delivery fee based on distance (Haversine formula on backend).
4. User initiates M-Pesa STK Push.
5. App polls the backend for payment confirmation.
6. On success, the order is placed and auto-dispatched to a rider.

### Tracking Flow
When an order status is `picked_up`, the app connects to `/ws/track/{order_id}` on the backend to receive live coordinates from the rider. The `react-native-maps` component smoothly animates the rider's marker to the new coordinates.
